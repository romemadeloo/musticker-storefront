// The storefront sits behind a WAF that rate-limits our single CI egress IP under full-suite load:
// the document request comes back as a bare nginx 403 Forbidden page instead of the app, in
// contiguous windows lasting from ~35s to well over a minute. Nothing is wrong with the site --
// the same URLs answer 200 on a manual re-check moments later.
//
// Playwright's own `retries: 2` cannot ride that out. Its three attempts run back-to-back with no
// backoff, so all of them land inside the same block window and the test dies on whatever content
// assertion follows the navigation ("element(s) not found" on a heading or the header banner),
// which says nothing about the real cause. Navigating through this helper instead re-requests the
// page with a growing delay before the caller ever asserts on content.
//
// The delays below spend ~54s over six attempts. Combined with Playwright's own retries that is
// ~168s of coverage, against a longest-observed window of ~100s (production run #99, 2026-09-01:
// both MS-V2-078 circle-sheet cases died on /kr/sheet-stickers/circle-sheet between 20:43:14 and
// 20:44:51 UTC, bracketed by passes on the identical URL six seconds before and immediately after).
// The previous ladder spent ~29s, so its three Playwright attempts covered ~96s and fell a few
// seconds short of that window -- the whole failure.
//
// The wait does not come out of the caller's assertion budget; see waitOutBlock. Without that, a
// ladder this long would hand a navigation that recovers on the last rung about five seconds to
// assert in, and the 60s per-test timeout would start failing tests that the throttling only
// delayed.
