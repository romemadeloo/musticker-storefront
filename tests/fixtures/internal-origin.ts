/**
 * Sends the WAF exemption key on every musticker.com request the browser makes.
 *
 * The storefront sits behind a WAF that rate-limits our CI egress IP under full-suite load, which
 * surfaces as bare 403s on documents and on their subresources (see navigation.ts). This header is
 * the exemption the site owner issued for CI; the retry ladder in navigation.ts stays as the safety
 * net for runs without it.
 *
 * Applied per-route rather than through `extraHTTPHeaders` because that option is context-wide, and
 * a production page load also talks to Google, DoubleClick and Naver -- 12 third-party hosts as of
 * 2026-08-28. The key must never be sent to any of them, so only musticker.com origins are
 * intercepted and every other request is left untouched.
 *
 * A no-op when the key is unset, which is the default locally and for dev-environment runs.
