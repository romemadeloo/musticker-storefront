// Storefront products mapped to their price table CSV: the twelve under /kr/stickers and the eight
// under /kr/roll-stickers. The six under /kr/sheet-stickers are deliberately absent -- see the note
// at the foot of the registry.
//
// CSVs live one folder per storefront category, named after the product slug. The server does NOT
// have a one-table-per-product layout: the 20 products below resolve to only 11 distinct pricing
// tables. circle / rectangle / square / oval / rounded share one, and six of the eight roll products
// share another. Products on a shared table must therefore hold matching CSVs, which
// product-table-mapping.spec.ts checks explicitly.
//
// TABLE IDS ARE PER ENVIRONMENT, AND THE ID NUMBERS COLLIDE ACROSS SERVERS. Probed live on
// 2026-08-24 (the sticker tables) and 2026-08-25 (everything else). Three groups vary independently:
//
//   the /kr/stickers sticker tables -- three generations in play
//     production            43/44/45/46/47   "... Sticker (8/24/2026)"       match the CSVs
//     development-1         45/46/47/49/50   "... Pricing (8/21/2026)"       match the CSVs
//     development-static-2  5/23/25/30/31    "Die Cut", "Clear - ..."        differ
//
//   the roll and lettering tables -- left out of that regeneration, one generation everywhere
//     all three servers     8/11/15/16/17    "Roll", "Vinyl Lettering"       match the CSVs
//
//   sticker-sheet -- same rates everywhere, but the id moved
//     production            33               "Sticker Sheet (7/13/2026)"     match the CSV
//     development-1         34               "Custom Sheet (7/10/2026) v3"   match the CSV
//     development-static-2  34               "Custom Sheet (7/10/2026) v3"   match the CSV
//
// The collision is the reason a single shared id map would be actively wrong rather than merely
// incomplete: id 45 is kiss-cut on production but die-cut on development-1, and 46/47 are
// clear/hologram on production but the shapes/kiss-cut tables on development-1. sticker-sheet is the
// same trap one category over -- id 34 is the no-material table on both development servers, but on
// production it is the PVC table.
//
// `csvSources` lists the environments a CSV is a valid baseline for. For the sticker tables that is
// production and development-1, promoted from the same price data -- verified cell by cell -- while
// development-static-2 still holds the older rates and is identity-checked only. The roll, lettering
// and sticker-sheet tables are identical on all three servers, so they list all three.
//
// The remaining development-* servers have no recorded ids yet; the pricing specs skip there with an
// explicit reason rather than guessing. Add an entry to `pricingIds` to switch a server on.
//
// `normalizedNr` is the rounding step in KRW that the API applies to the line total. It is 100
// everywhere except sticker-sheet, which uses 10, and is stable across all three generations.
//
// hologram-sticker serves both 다이컷 and 키스컷 from one table (supply_id does not change the
// quote), which is why its CSV is a merged die-cut/kiss-cut export.

  //
  //   - circle/oval/square/rectangle/rounded-sheet (tables 40/41/42 by material) answer with a
  //     SHEET-keyed ladder: data.prices carries one entry per sheet count (5, 10, 20, 50, ...) whose
  //     `nr` is stickers-per-sheet x sheets, so a request for quantity=100 comes back with entries
  //     at nr 120, 240, 480 ... and never at 100. quotedPrice() looks up prices by the requested
  //     quantity and would throw on every row.
  //   - Their tables are also banded rather than full grids: the export pads unavailable
  //     (area, quantity) combinations with 0, and the API omits those rungs from the stored row
  //     entirely, so a straight CSV-to-row comparison sees the zero cells as missing.
  //   - die-cut-sheet (tables 37/38/39) answers `success: false "Unable show of pricing."` to a
  //     plain width/height/quantity probe at all -- it is the A5-template flow and needs the
  //     sheet-template parameters the configurator sends.
  //
  // Wiring these up needs sheet-aware helpers in pricing-api.ts and a quantity model that
  // understands the sheet ladder; the CSVs are committed now so that work has a baseline to
  // start from.
