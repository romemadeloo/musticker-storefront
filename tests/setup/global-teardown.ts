/**
 * Deletes the throwaway members the destructive auth tests registered during this run.
 *
 * Wired as `globalTeardown` rather than as a teardown *project* on purpose: every npm script in this
 * repo selects tests with `--grep`, and a project's tests are grep-filtered like any others, so a
 * teardown project would silently not run for `--grep @destructive` (its own title carries no tag).
 * A global teardown always runs.
 *
 * Deleting needs an admin endpoint the storefront does not expose, so this is a no-op -- loud, but
 * not a failure -- until `TEST_DATA_USER_DELETE_ENDPOINT` is configured. The ledger is left intact in
 * that case so the accounts stay accounted for and a later configured run can still clear them.
